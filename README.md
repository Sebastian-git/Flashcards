# FlashCards

### Introduction
This flashcards program was meant to help studying a broad range of topics. Flashcards for any topic can be saved into a file with a front name and a back description for later viewing from a GUI.


### Usage

There are three text entry options:

* Category - Turns into the name of the new file that will be used for storing the flashcards.

* Name - Turns into the front side of the flashcard.

* Description - Turns into the back side of the flashcard.

Below the text entries, there are four different buttons:

* Submit: After filling out the category, name, and description, submit saves the card into the specified file.

* Cards: To open a flashcard, only type in the file name into "Category", and click cards to begin using them.

* Remove: This removes a flashcard after the category and name is specified.

* Help: Gives a summary of what each button and text entry is for.

When files are saved onto a file, it will be in the following format:
``` front::back ```

To flip flashcards back and forth, press ``` space ```

To skip to the next card, press ``` enter ```

### Examples
