### Introduction
This flashcards program was meant to help studying a broad range of topics. If the program is being run for the first time, there will be a new file named "database" created. 


### Usage

* Category - Turns into the name of the new file that will be used for storing the flashcards.

* Name - Turns into the front side of the flashcard.

Below the text entries, there are four different buttons:

* Submit: After filling out the category, name, and description, submit saves the card into the specified file.

* Cards: To open a flashcard, only type in the file name into "Category", and click cards to begin using them.

* Remove: This removes a flashcard after the category and name is specified.

* Help: Gives a summary of what each button and text entry is for.
